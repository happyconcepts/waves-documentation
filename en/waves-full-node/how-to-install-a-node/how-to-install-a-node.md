# How to Install a Node

To run the Waves node have to go through 2 steps:

1. Install the JRE 1.8 \(**64-bit version**\).
2. Download Waves package and configure the application.

**P.S.** you can check Waves Releases [Here](https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves/releases).

**Prior to the launch of your nodes, make sure you read the **[**configuration specification**](/waves-full-node/configuration-parameters.md)**! The default configuration does not contain the safest solution!**

More specific steps depend on your operating system:

* [On Mac](/waves-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/on-mac.md)
* [On Windows](/waves-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/on-windows.md)
* [On Ubuntu](/waves-full-node/how-to-install-a-node/on-ubuntu.md)

# System Requirements

**The Minimal requirements are:**

* 1 vCPU
* 1Gb RAM
* 30Gb SSD

**Recommended configuration are:**

* 2+ vCPU
* 4Gb RAM
* +30Gb SSD

# Activation Process of New Features

When some new feature is developed and released, it must be activated. 

* Activation process consists of "**voting**" period and "**activation**" period. Each mining node \(which generates blocks\) can set in its configuration a parameter to vote for this new feature. After that all blocks generated by such a node contain the vote for the feature.

*  Every 3000 blocks on testnet \(10000 blocks on mainnet\) - it's an **election period**. If there are not less than 2700 blocks on testnet \(8000 blocks on mainnet\) with support of the feature during the election period, the feature becomes "**voted**". After it's "**voted**" there is a period of "**activation**" - 3000 blocks for testnet \(10000 blocks for mainnet\). After they all passed, the feature start working. At this moment all nodes which can not supports such feature \(old versions\) stops.
