# How to get enough Waves for the fees?

As you may know, Waves is the primary currency of the whole Wavesplatform. So, before creating an order or outgoing transfer, please make sure that you have enough **Waves**.

The fee for creating one buy or sell order on the DEX platform is **0.003 Waves**. To create an outgoing transfer from the wallet will cost you **0.001 Waves**.

If you have enough assets (**BTC/ETH/LTC/ZEC/USD/EUR** and so on) and if these assets have sufficient value, exchange them for Waves without having initial Waves using the internal DEX exchange.

For more information, please follow the instructions:

* [Start trading on the Waves DEX](/waves-client/waves-dex/start-trading-on-the-waves-dex.md)
* [iOS: Start trading on the Waves DEX](/waves-client/mobile-apps/iOS/waves-dex/start-trading-on-the-waves-dex.md)
* [Android: Start trading on the Waves DEX](/waves-client/mobile-apps/android/waves-dex/start-trading-on-the-waves-dex.md)

**Warning** When you are exchanging assets to get the initial Waves tokens for the fees. Please take into account the exchanging amount, since order fee is 0.003 Waves. So, to get 0.001 Waves you should buy at least 0.004 Waves.
